This repo contains all the files mentione in the article "Let’s get physical: how to represent data through touch".

The article contains a tutorial on how to create two 3D printed maps portraying data from the website Inside Airbnb, 
an independent watchdog that collects data to help researchers assess the impact of Airbnb in their city’s housing stock. 
We’ll focus on two European cities that symbolically sit at the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of regulation: 
Barcelona and Venice. 
On one hand, Barcelona can be seen at the frontlines in restricting touristic short-term rentals through a system of licenses 
and quotas, and via a direct agreement with Airbnb to access hosts’ data. 
On the other, Venice has very limited regulation, mostly on tax issues. 
Specifically, we are going to visualise  physicalise the number of entire apartment listings in a hexagon grid map.
Once you familiarise yourself with the process, this same process can be repeated for any of the 70+ cities for which you find data on the Inside Airbnb website. 

We are going to design the maps separately, so that they can be presented independently or next to each other like a series of small multiples maps. 

The design and fabrication of these maps have been developed by [Chi ha ucciso il Conte?](http://chihauccisoilconte.eu/), and Italian designer and expert in digital fabrication and open source software.
